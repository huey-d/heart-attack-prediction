# heart-attack-analysis-prediction-project
Building, Optimizing, and Deploying ML model using the Heart Attack Prediction Dataset

Link (from Kaggle) to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

The first step I did before downloading the dataset was to make the directories using utils.py

I've used the command line to download the dataset and unzip the file into the "data" directory using:

kaggle datasets download -d rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset --unzip -p data\datasets
